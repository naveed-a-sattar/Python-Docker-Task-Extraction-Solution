# Python Docker Solution: Task Extraction

This README.md file provides a solution to a problem related to running Python code inside Docker containers and accessing local network resources. The issue at hand is how to perform task extraction using Python within a Docker environment. Follow the steps below to implement the proposed solution.

## Problem Description

When running Python code inside a Docker container, there is a concern that the container may not have access to the necessary resources, such as databases or established connections on the local machine. The goal is to find a way for the Python code running within the Docker container to utilize these connections and successfully perform task extraction.

## Solution Overview

To solve the problem, we propose a two-step approach:

1. **Step 1: Compile Python Code in a Docker Container**

   Create a Dockerfile that compiles the Python code and builds a new Docker image containing the compiled code. This ensures that the code is ready for execution in the next Docker container.

2. **Step 2: Execute Task Extraction in a Separate Docker Container**

   Utilize the Docker image created in the first step to run a second Docker container. This container will act as a service to perform the task extraction. By using this approach, the Python code can run within the Docker environment and have access to the required network resources.

## Implementation Steps

Follow the steps below to implement the proposed solution:

1. **Compile Python Code**

   Create a Dockerfile that includes the necessary instructions to compile your Python code. This may involve installing dependencies, setting up the environment, and copying the code into the container.

2. **Build the Docker Image**

   Use the Dockerfile to build the Docker image. Run the following command in the terminal, ensuring that you are in the same directory as the Dockerfile:

   ```
   docker build -t my-python-app .
   ```

   This command will build the Docker image with the name `my-python-app`. Adjust the tag name as needed.

3. **Run the Task Extraction Container**

   Once the Docker image is built, you can run a new Docker container based on that image. This container will serve as the service to perform the task extraction. Use the following command to run the container:

   ```
   docker run --name task-extraction -p <host_port>:<container_port> my-python-app
   ```

   Replace `<host_port>` with the port number on your local machine that you want to map to the `<container_port>` used by the Python code for task extraction.

4. **Access the Task Extraction Service**

   With the Docker container running, you can now access the task extraction service through your local machine's network. Use the appropriate network address, such as `localhost:<host_port>`, to interact with the service and perform the desired task extraction.

## Expected Results

By following the steps outlined in this README.md file, you should be able to successfully run Python code inside a Docker container and perform task extraction while having access to the necessary network resources.

## Conclusion

This solution provides a way to overcome the limitation of accessing local network resources when running Python code inside a Docker container. By separating the compilation and execution steps into two Docker containers, we ensure that the code runs within the Docker environment while still utilizing the required network connections. Please refer to the steps outlined above to implement this solution and achieve successful task extraction using Python and Docker.
